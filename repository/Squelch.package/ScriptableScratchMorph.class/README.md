I am the superclass of all scriptable Scratch morphs.

Scriptable morphs:
  1. allow the user to add user-defined scripts
  2. allow the user to add user-defined variables
  3. when they are copied, their scripts and variables are copied;
     thereafter, script changes to the original and the copy are entirely independent
  4. can be exported and imported into another Scratch project.
