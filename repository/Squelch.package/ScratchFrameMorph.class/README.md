I am the top level user interface for Scratch. I tile the screen with a toolbar, a work pane (for content), a viewer pane, and a script editor pane. I can resize myself to fill the entire Squeak window.

I keep a list of Scratch processes (threads) and run each one to the its next stopping point when I am stepped each screen update cycle.
