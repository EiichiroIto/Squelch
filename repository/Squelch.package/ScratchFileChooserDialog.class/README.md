I am a File Chooser dialog box for Scratch. My submorphs vary according to my function. For example, I may show a project thumbnail, I may have a typein field to allow the user to enter a new file name, or I may have buttons to create or paint a new sprite.

You can also use me to select an existing or create a new file or folder. Some examples:

  ScratchFileChooserDialog chooseFile
  ScratchFileChooserDialog chooseFile: FileDirectory default enableNew: false
