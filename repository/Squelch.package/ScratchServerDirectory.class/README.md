I represent a virtual Scratch 'directory' that is actually stored on an HTTP server. A directory is actually a web page, where links from that page appear as subdirectories.

This is not meant to be used with on arbitrary web pages. Instead, it's meant to view a repository of Scratch projects structured like a folder hierarchy.
